Questions to help you:

What Kubernetes resource type deploys and manages pods?
How many replicas (copies) of the wisecow app should run?
What port does the wisecow app use? (Hint: check wisecow.sh)
What Docker image will you use? (Will it be from Docker Hub or a local image?)

## Note on Testing
- Tested on AWS EC2 t2.micro with 1 replica due to CPU constraints
- Production deployment should use `replicas: 2` for high availability
- Recommended instance: t2.small or higher for full functionality
